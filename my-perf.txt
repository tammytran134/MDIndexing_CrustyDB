1. Strategy: I just simply change every Join execution from NLJ to Hash Join in optimizer.rs.
2. I spent about 2 hours every day debugging errors that I couldn't see on my computer,
then only after going to OH that I learnt to run it on CSIL, and even after the tests
have passed on both my local computer and CSIL, it still crashed on Gradescope due to
stack overflow issues. I was able to fix it in the end, but one suggestion I have is to
make the correctness tests more robust than the benchmark tests so we know where we are 
getting it wrong.
